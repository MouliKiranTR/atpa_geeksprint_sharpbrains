**Pull Request Template:**
We used to have the pull request template for the `CP-UI` application in `Github`. Not sure, still we have that template somewhere after we migrated to `ADO`. I see a similar kind of template [here](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/08/04/a-github-pull-request-template-for-your-projects/). Probably we can take a look and finalize the template for backend and frontend applications.
