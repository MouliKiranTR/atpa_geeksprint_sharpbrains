## **Overview**
The goal is to capture the list of false positive cases from different Snyk vulnerability categories along with a brief description. This will help us to interact with the ISRM team and submit support tickets to the Snyk support team.

please email `support@snyk.io` to submit a support ticket to the Snynk support team. Also, copy to `thomson-appsec@thomsonreuters.com` and other stack holders (@<4034272D-272B-6237-9FC3-F056504F10EA>, @<6E1066E8-628D-4265-A95B-1417346FA748>, and @<11C316C4-6C0D-643A-A6FF-6BCA030586D6>) to the email chain. We will create an email distribution list for the Checkpoint Snyk team soon which we will use while submitting a support ticket to the Snyk support team.

## **False Positive Cases**
Here is the list of false positive cases from different vulnerabilities flagged by Snyk. Please capture the following information for each false positive case:
- Link to the Snyk issue
- Screenshot of the relevant positive case (this will help to take a look at the issue right away)
- Brief explanation of why it's a false positive case
- Anything else?
