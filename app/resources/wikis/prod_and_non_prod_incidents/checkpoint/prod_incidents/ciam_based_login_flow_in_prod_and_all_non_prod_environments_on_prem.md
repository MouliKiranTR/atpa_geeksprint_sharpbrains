Due to problems on the CloudFlare side, the CIAM-based login flow was broken in all Checkpoint environments including PROD, and the the overall outage time was around 2.5 to 2.45 hours. This is the major outage since we launched the CIAM functionality.

Please note that CloudFlare is the network provider of auth0 and auth0 is the vendor of the CIAM platform. TR's CIAM platform doesn't directly deal with CloudFlare. More details will be added later but Here is the summary of the issue that Jamaica from the DevOps team outlined.
