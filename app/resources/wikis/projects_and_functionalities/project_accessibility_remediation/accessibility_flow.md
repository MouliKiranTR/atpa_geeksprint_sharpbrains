By following these steps, you can minimize the risk of unintended changes to existing functionality while implementing accessibility improvements. Remember, the goal is to enhance the application without disrupting the user experience for your current users.

To implement accessibility improvements and handle bug fixes without disrupting existing functionality, follow these steps:
 
1. **Reproduce the Bug**:
   - First, try to reproduce the bug to determine if the issue still exists. Some bugs might have been resolved internally due to constant updates in Checkpoint.
 
2. **Analyze the Component**:
   - List all current functionalities and user interactions.
   - Document the current behavior and expected outcomes.
   - Create a comprehensive list of common and edge case scenarios.
 
3. **Identify the Problem**:
   - If the bug persists, identify the problem, the Checkpoint section where it is located, and verify if it affects any other sections.
   - If the bug fix has a significant impact (functionally or visually) perceptible to all users, discuss the fix with the Product Owner and other Managers to ensure they are aware and can provide input on the changes.
 
4. **Perform Baseline Testing**:
   - Execute your test plan on the current version.
   - Record the results, including any quirks or known issues.
 
5. **Implement Changes**:
   - Make the necessary code changes to fix the bug and/or improve accessibility.
 
6. **Perform Regression Testing**:
   - Re-run the entire test plan on the updated version.
   - Compare results with baseline testing in the development (DEV) environment.
   - Pay special attention to areas directly affected by your changes.
 
7. **Conduct Accessibility-Specific Testing**:
   - Test the new accessibility features.
   - Ensure they work as intended without interfering with existing functionality.
 
8. **Cross-Browser and Device Testing** (if applicable):
   - Repeat tests on different browsers and devices.
   - Ensure consistency across all platforms.
 
9. **User Flow Testing**:
   - Walk through common user scenarios from start to finish.
   - Verify that the overall user experience remains intact.
 
10. **Performance Testing**:
    - Check if the changes have impacted load times or responsiveness.
 
11. **Run Automated Tests**:
    - In **cp-web-app**, run the entire test suite and additionally execute the Ant task "runGulpTests".
    - In **cp-ui**, run tests using the command `node --max_old_space_size=8192 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng test`.
 
12. **Seek Feedback**:
    - If possible, have other team members or users test the changes.
    - Consider obtaining input from users with disabilities.
 
13. **Document Changes and Results**:
    - Note any differences in behavior, even if they seem minor.
    - Update documentation if necessary.
 
14. **Create and Review the Pull Request (PR)**:
    - Once tests have passed successfully, create the PR and request reviews in the Team Drogon chat.
    - When the PR is approved, complete it. Expect the builds to finish and the deployment to be done in DEV. To track build progress, check the appropriate link.
 
15. **Deployment and Verification in DEV**:
    - After deploying in DEV, verify that your changes are reflected correctly and that they do not affect other sections.
    - Change the bug status to Resolved and assign it to our Checkpoint QA.
 
16. **Additional Code Comments**:
    - Be mindful of hard-to-read sections of your code and add comments on that functionality if necessary.

17. **Mobile**
    - For mobile related bugs refer to https://checkpoint.riag.com/app/mobile/login using Chrome in mobile view

Remember, the goal is to improve the application without disrupting the current user experience.
