#Short description
In the Checkpoint Edge application, a key aspect of our value proposition is offering top-quality content tailored for specific tasks and varying levels of expertise. When a user selects a topic, we guide them to the most relevant advice and resources from our leading editorial collection, tailored to the specific work they are engaged in, or we help them conduct a precise search within that topic area.

Our "Featured Editorial Materials" section presents users with a curated selection of content related to their topics of interest by our subject matter expert from the Editorial team. This content, which includes Recent News, State Charts, Nexus Assistant, Planning & Advisory, Compliance & Return Filing, and Primary Sources, among others, is readily available in our existing NOVUS repository.

Topic Pages enable users to access content in a new way – no need to construct the perfect search parameters or have in-depth knowledge about the use cases for Checkpoint’s various content sets. 

Users will be able to easily browse to the topic and subtopic of interest to find good starting points for the type of work they’re doing or dive deeper into their research by running a targeted search within the subtopic. 

Topic Pages are designed for tax professionals of all experience levels whether they’re working for a big law firm or accounting firm, in-house at a corporation, or practicing solo. 
Topic Pages were created by tax experts who have an extensive understanding of Checkpoint’s content and value propositions. The layout and presentation have been refined through multiple rounds of user feedback and testing.
