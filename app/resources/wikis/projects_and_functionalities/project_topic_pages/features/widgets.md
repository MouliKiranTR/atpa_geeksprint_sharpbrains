### Short Description
A widget on Topic Pages is an independent, reusable UI component designed to perform a specific function. In this context, it offers Checkpoint users detailed information about a particular subject. These widgets are reusable because they function as standalone components.

### Type of widgets
Here is a list of widget types for Topic Pages
- #### TD - Topic description
A high-level summary of the subtopic provides users with quick validation that they're in the right place and helpful context for their further research.  The summary is not dynamic based on jurisdiction; it will be consisted across all jurisdictions for a subtopic.
