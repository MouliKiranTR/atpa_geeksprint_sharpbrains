Checkpoint has two tools for gathering information on customer usage:
 
## Webstat tool:
- http://c223pgjcpdvpb.int.westgroup.com:3108/ReportProcessor/
- This tool is to pull out reports on how the customer uses their Checkpoint products; as well as acknowledging the amount of time the users from each account spend using the products, when they access their account and how much time they spend online. 
- This data is pulled from CUAS database

## Checkpoint Usage Report Tool:
